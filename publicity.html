            <p>With nearly 8 million followers on social media,
               Cornellà is highly-regarded on the international stage and his works have been exhibited from Hong Kong,
               Tokyo, Seoul and Beijing to London, Paris and New York.
               With a simplistic visual language and cheerful palette, Cornellà uses satire to comment on the bleak side of human nature,
               creating works that are honest, entertaining and stimulating.
               In 2020, the artist’s well-established style has evolved with the combination of text and imagery,
               as he continues to explore the possibilities of universal resonance with humor.</p>
