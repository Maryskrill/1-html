            <p style="background-color: white;">As everyone know, the works of Joan Cornellà are irony. Selfie is one of the weird things in his mind.
               There is another one of his work about selfie below.There is always people willing to do silly things and bring proud of it. They took selfie in front of the “flycatcher” and checked-in on Facebook. I am afraid I will not be sharing these photos here.

               Selfie, it maybe just a symbol. What Joan Cornellà trying to tease may not be selfie itself. It can be all kind of weird and violative things in our city, like the people lying by the pole in MTR train; the one who trim his nails in restaurant; who queue up for two hours to buy “buy one get one free” ice-cream; and also who defecate in public… Those kill  animals just for fun and show of on internet. Even thought they were despised by the world, they just don’t care and continue.
               
               Some people didn’t take selfie but demanded their friend to take photos of them in front of every single works, one with no pose, one that copying the pose in the work; retaking another one because the last wasn’t good enough…</p>
